It's emotionally draining, and physically too. I'm trying to find the strength to keep going, but it's tough. I just needed to vent and reach out, you know? Sometimes I wish I had a magic wand to fix everything. How are you doing? I could really use some solidarity right now."

I've been dealing with a lot with my dad's caregiving, and today was particularly tough. I'm just not in the right headspace for a swim right now. It's not you, it's me. I hope you understand. Maybe we can catch up another time when I'm feeling more like myself."
