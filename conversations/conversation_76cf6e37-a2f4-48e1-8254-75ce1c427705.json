My dad gets so confused in the late afternoon and evening, and I can see the frustration in his eyes - which makes me feel even worse. I'm trying my best, but some days it feels like nothing I do helps. *voice sounds weary* I love him so much, but this Alzheimer's journey is just grinding me down, you know? I'm constantly worried I'm not doing enough, or doing things right."

Finding respite care is challenging, and honestly, the thought of taking time for myself feels both appealing and guilt-inducing. *sighs* Most days, I'm lucky if I can grab a quick shower while he's napping. But thanks for the suggestion - it sounds nice in theory."

With his Alzheimer's, he could wander off, hurt himself, or get completely disoriented if I'm not here. A swim isn't something I can just do on a whim. *voice softens, becomes more vulnerable* I know you're trying to help, but my life isn't simple right now. Caregiving isn't just a job - it's my entire world right now. Maybe another time, but definitely not today."
